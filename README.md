## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] `>=16`
- [npm][npm] v8.16.0 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Demo

Hosted on [Book Ocean](https://book-ocean.vercel.app/discover)

## Setup

> If you want to commit and push your work as you go, you'll want to
> [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
> first and then clone your fork rather than this repo directly.

### Workflow

- Checkout the exercise branch
- Read through the `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Start exercise
- Go through every mentioned file and follow the instructions from the emoji
- We all come back together
- I go through the solution and answer questions
- Move on to the next exercise.
- Repeat.

### App Data Model

- User

  - id: string
  - username: string

- List Item

  - id: string
  - bookId: string
  - ownerId: string
  - rating: number (-1 is no rating, otherwise it's 1-5)
  - notes: string
  - startDate: number (`Date.now()`)
  - finishDate: number (`Date.now()`)

> For convenience, our friendly backend engineers also return a `book` object on
> each list item which is the book it's associated to. Thanks backend folks!

> /me wishes we could use GraphQL

If your "database" gets out of whack, you can purge it via:

```javascript
window.__bookshelf.purgeUsers()
window.__bookshelf.purgeListItems()
```

- Book

  - id: string
  - title: string
  - author: string
  - coverImageUrl: string
  - pageCount: number
  - publisher: string
  - synopsis: string

## Troubleshooting

<details>
  
  <summary>Running "node go" does not list any branches</summary>
  
This means there was something wrong when you ran the setup. Try running:

```
node ./scripts/track-branches.js
```

If you're still not getting the branches, then you can do this manually:

```
git branch --track "exercises/01-bootstrap" "origin/exercises/01-bootstrap"
git branch --track "exercises/02-styles" "origin/exercises/02-styles"
git branch --track "exercises/03-data-fetching" "origin/exercises/03-data-fetching"
git branch --track "exercises/04-authentication" "origin/exercises/04-authentication"
git branch --track "exercises/05-routing" "origin/exercises/05-routing"
git branch --track "exercises/06-cache-management" "origin/exercises/06-cache-management"
git branch --track "exercises/07-context" "origin/exercises/07-context"
git branch --track "exercises/08-compound-components" "origin/exercises/08-compound-components"
git branch --track "exercises/09-performance" "origin/exercises/09-performance"
git branch --track "exercises/10-render-as-you-fetch" "origin/exercises/10-render-as-you-fetch"
git branch --track "exercises/11-unit-testing" "origin/exercises/11-unit-testing"
git branch --track "exercises/12-testing-hooks-and-components" "origin/exercises/12-testing-hooks-and-components"
git branch --track "exercises/13-integration-testing" "origin/exercises/13-integration-testing"
git branch --track "exercises/14-e2e-testing" "origin/exercises/14-e2e-testing"

git pull --all
```
